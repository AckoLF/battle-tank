Jump to your compiler's folder (for example C:\Program Files\CodeBlocks\MinGW) , and copy the following files

curses.h >> include\
pdcurses.lib >> lib\
pdcurses.dll >> bin\

When linking all object files (with GCC) , append -lpdcurses switch to the command, so compiler would know to link the curses library also.

If you are using some IDE, you can configure your enviroment to automaticaly link this library. Find the linker options, and add there "pdcurses".
