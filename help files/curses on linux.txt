For installing ncurses on linux debian-based distributions, just type the following into terminal:

sudo apt-get install libncurses5-dev

Also, append -lncurses to the end of the command (GCC) so the compiler would know to link the curses library also

If you are using some IDE, you can configure your enviroment to automaticaly link this library. Find the linker options, and add there "ncurses".
